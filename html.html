            <h3>SMART ATTENDENCE SYSTEM</h3>
            <br>
          <p>The Smart Attendance System, developed by us, is an advanced solution that incorporates NodeMCU, an LCD display, an RFID scanner, and RFID tags to revolutionize attendance tracking. As employees scan their RFID tags with the RFID scanner, NodeMCU processes the data and displays attendance information in real time on the LCD display. The scanned data is seamlessly uploaded to our custom-designed Smart Attendance System app, granting immediate access to attendance records and valuable analytics. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive data management, the system simultaneously integrates the information into Google Excel sheets. This seamless integration of hardware and software empowers organizations to efficiently manage attendance, optimize resources, and make data-driven decisions.</p>
